# Helicopter Simulator

The Helicopter Simulator is a console-based game where you control a helicopter within a 20x20 frame. Your objective is to navigate the helicopter through various challenges while managing limited resources.

## Features

- **Real-time Helicopter Flight**: Experience the thrill of piloting a virtual helicopter as you navigate through a dynamic environment.
- **Forest Fire Events**: Periodically, the forest within the game catches fire, creating obstacles that you must navigate around or extinguish.
- **River Reservoirs**: Fly over the river to fill up your reservoirs, which act as your water supply for firefighting.
- **Firefighting**: Encounter fires within the game and use your water reserves to extinguish them.
- **Thunderstorm Clouds**: Beware of thunderstorm clouds! Flying into them will cause damage to your helicopter and decrease your life points.
- **Upgrade Shop**: Accumulate points by successfully extinguishing fires and unlock upgrades in the shop. Upgrade your maximum reservoir capacity to enhance your firefighting abilities.
- **Life Points**: Your helicopter has a limited number of life points. Colliding with obstacles or thunderstorm clouds will reduce your life points. Be cautious and plan your movements carefully!
